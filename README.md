# Academic Research Paper Outline
The following is a typical outline for research papers. In this sample outline, we will use the following research problem as an example: **build a system to improve the quality of online reviews**.

## Outline Sample

**1. Introduction**
- Describe the backgound of the current online reviews. 
- Explain that online reviews have been playing a critical role in helping users make important purchase decisions.
- Point out that there are certain problems about online reviews in general. For instance, there are fake reviews or insufficient reviews.
- Talk about how the current system handles it. For instance, Yelp trusts most of the reviews unless people complain. Google uses an algorithm to filter out the fake reviews. Then, you need to talk about the limitations of these current systems or approaches. Why are these not enough.
- Summarize the solution you have built to solve this problem. For instance, we have developed a system to let users upload support documents to prove that the review is real, which can be verified automatically by comptuers. Also, we use machine learning to predict certain review results when there are not many reviews avaiable yet.
- Present the organization of the rest of the paper (see the sample paper for an example).

**2. Motivating Example**
- Provides a simple example of certain Yelp review that contains the fake reviews; or certain places that do not have sufficient reviews, which makes it difficult to make the dicision for users.

**3. Challenges**
- This section allows you to further elaborate the problems in details. You should list at least 3 challenges related with your problem. For each challenge, you need to talk about exactly what the problem is and use an example (based on the motiviating example) to further discuss it.
- Challenge 1: Users post a large amount of fake reviews for various purposes.
- Challenge 2: Users sometimes post incorrect review information by accident. For instance, a user may post a positive review but give a one-star review out of five.
- Challenge 3: Users sometimes cannot make the correct decision due to the lack of reviews 

**4. Solution**
- You should have an overview of the solution at the beginning. Talk about how it works, and what are the steps/components in this system.
- Give the technical details on how you implement each of the component. What kinds of tools/algorithms/service have you used to build each component. 
- Describe the step/feature 1 and the rationale behind it. 
- Describe the step/feature 2 and the rationale behind it
- Describe the step/feature 3 and the rationale behind it

**5. Empirical Results**
- In this section, you should talk about how your solution solves the problems. If you have done some experiments, show it with tables and charts. Otherwise, you should at least talk about how your solution helps to address these challenges.
- Experiment 1: how your feature 1 solves the Challenge 1
- Experiment 2: how your feature 1 solves the Challenge 2
- Experiment 3: how your feature 1 solves the Challenge 3

**6. Related Work**
- You need to find out the existing work and the references. You can simply search some of the keywords (e.g., online review, reivew validation) in Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/).
- Make sure you have the references cited here. You want to talk about what others have done, and how yours differeniates from others.

**7. Conclusion and Future Work**
- Summarize again what you have done.
- Talk about the current limitations and how do you plan to solve these limitations.

**8. References**
